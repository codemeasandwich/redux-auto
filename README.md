### asynchronous

In Redux your reducer returns a state object. This is very straight forward, but makes dealing with asynchronous updates quite tricky (there are [more than 60 different libraries](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/side-effects.md) tackling this problem).

redux-auto fixes this asynchronous problem simply by allowing you to create an ["action" function that returns a promise](#action-files). To accompany your "default" function action logic.

> [asynchronous: example](https://github.com/codemeasandwich/redux-auto/blob/master/example/store/user/init.js)

1) No need for other Redux async middleware. e.g. thunk, promise-middleware, saga
2) Easily allows you to pass a promise into redux and have it managed for you
3) Allows you to co-locate external service calls with where they will be transformed
4) Naming the file "**init**.js" will have it called once at app start. This is good for loading data from the server to warm up you client cache.

## Overview

Steps:

1) Create a folder to represent your store
	* This is where the data, logic & flow control of the application lives. This can be named whatever, just point to it with webpacks - require.context
2) In this folder you will create folders to represent each attribute on the store
	* For example. the "user" folder will create an attribute of 'user'
	* the JS files within the folder are **actions** that can be fired to change the shape of user.
3) Create an index.js file to set default values
	* **[export default](#default)** is a catch all reducer function *(if an action cant be found)*
	* export "[before](#before)" & "[after](#after)" as lifecycle functions
4) Create js files with the name of the [action](#action-files) you want it mapped to
	* **export default** is the reducer function
	* export "action" function. Is an **action-middleware** that will allow you to create promises
5) You can create an init.js It will be automatically run once after store created
	* using this to initialize from an API

Example layout:
```
â””â”€â”€ store/ (1)
    â””â”€â”€user/ (2)
       â””â”€â”€ index.js (3)
       â””â”€â”€ changeName.js (4)
       â””â”€â”€ init.js (5)
```


## setup

[Example of setup file](https://github.com/codemeasandwich/redux-auto/blob/master/example/main.jsx)

### Inside your setup file **Web-App*

```JS
...
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { auto, reducers } from 'redux-auto';
...
// load the folder that hold you store
const webpackModules = require.context("./store", true, /\.js$/);
...
                                // build 'auto' based on target files via Webpack
const middleware = applyMiddleware( auto(webpackModules, webpackModules.keys()))
const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers), middleware );
...
```

###  Inside your API file **Server-side Rendering*
```JS
...
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server
import { genStore, fsModules } from 'redux-auto';
import Main from './Main';
...
const webpackModules = fsModules("./store")
...
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    // Only load "user" in store and timeout 5 sec
    genStore(webpackModules, ["user"], 5000)
      .then( store => {
            res.send(ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<Main store={store} />)))
       }).catch( err => {
            // check your init promise are completing
           res.status(500).send("Problem in getting your page");
       })
})
...
```

### Inside your setup file **React-Native*

âž¡ If you want to use Redux-auto in a **React-Native project**. You will just need to install the [babel-plugin-redux-auto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-redux-auto) to allow to dynamic importing of your store.
1. `npm i babel-plugin-redux-auto`
2. Add **'babel-plugin-redux-auto'** to your **plugins** within your babel config

Now back to the setup...

```JS
...
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { auto, reducers } from 'redux-auto';
...
// load the folder that hold you store
import nativeStore from './store/*'
...
const middleware = applyMiddleware( auto(nativeStore))
const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers), middleware );
...
```

### Using along side an existing Redux setup.

```JS
...
// import your exiting reducers
import reducers from './reducers';
// include mergeReducers
import { auto, mergeReducers } from 'redux-auto';
...
// pass into: reducers >> mergeReducers >> combineReducers
const store = createStore(combineReducers(mergeReducers(reducers)), middleware );
...
```

### Using along side other Redux middleware. **Web-App*

```JS
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { auto, reducers } from 'redux-auto';
...
                    // pass all the middlewares in a normal arguments
const middleware = applyMiddleware( logger, auto(webpackModules, webpackModules.keys()))
const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers), middleware );
```

### Using along side other Redux middleware. **React-Native*

```JS
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { auto, reducers } from 'redux-auto';
...
                    // pass all the middlewares in a normal arguments
const middleware = applyMiddleware( logger, auto(nativeStore))
const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers), middleware );
```

### actions are available in the UI

Just import "redux-auto" and the actions are automatically available by default

```JS
import actions from 'redux-auto'
...
//action[folder][file]( data )
action.apps.chageAppName({appId:123})
```

## action files

The action file lives within your attribute folder and becomes the exposed action.
The default export should be a function that will take 1) your piece of the state 2) the payload data


Example: of an action to update the logged-in users name

```JS
// e.g. /store/user/changeUserName.js
export default function (user, payload) {
  return Object.assign({}, user,{ name : payload.name } );
}
```

â˜… Sometimes we want to talk to the server. This is done by action-middleware

This is done by exporting a function named "action" that returns a promise. The default function will now receive a 3rd argument "state". With the 2nd argument being the payload used to create the request

Example: saving the uses name to the server

```JS
// /store/user/changeUserName.js

export default function (user, payload, stage, data) {
switch(stage){
    case 'FULFILLED':
     // ...
      break;
    case 'REJECTED':
     // ...
      break;
    case 'PENDING':
    default :
     // ...
      break;
  }
  return user;
}

export function action (payload,user){
	return fetch('/api/foo/bar/user/'+payload.userId)
}
```

An alternative declaration for the same as above

```JS
// /store/user/changeUserName.js

export function pending (posts, payload){
  return posts
}

export function fulfilled (posts, payload, serverPosts){
  return serverPosts
}

export function rejected (posts, payload, error){
  return posts;
}

export function action (payload,posts){
	return fetch('/api/foo/bar/user/'+payload.userId)
}
```

### chaining actions together

You chain actions back-to-back by setting an "chain" property on the exported function.

Attach a function as the "chain" property

**Example:**
/store/user/getInfo
```JS
export function fulfilled (user, payload, userFromServer){
  return userFromServer;
} fulfilled.chain = (user, payload, userFromServer) => actions.nav.move({page:"home"})

export function rejected (user, payload, userFromServer){
  return userFromServer;
} rejected.chain = actions.user.reset

export function pending (user, payload){
  return user
}

export function action (payload){
	return fetch('/api/foo/bar/user/'+payload.userId)
}
```

If you pass your own function. Like with the **'fulfilled'** example. It will be passed all the arguments, the same as the host function was.

Else you can pass **thought** an "redux-auto" action function. Like with the **'rejected'** example. It will called without any arguments.

So calling "**actions.user.getInfo({userId:1})**" will automatically call  **actions.nav.move** with the host arguments OR **actions.user.reset** *with out arguments.

#### chaining to dispatcher

Chained functions can call the dispatcher directly.To trigger the dispatcher from your chain you need to return an `object` with a `type` and `payload`

**Example:**
```JS
import { push, replace } from 'react-router-redux';

export default function highLightFirend(friendID, {id}) {
  return id;
}

// This will call the 3rd party "router" reducer

highLightFirend.chain = (friendID, {id})=>{

  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

  if (!id) {
    searchParams.delete("friend");
    const url = window.location.pathname+"#"+searchParams.toString()
    return replace(url) // { type: '@@router/LOCATION_CHANGE',  payload: { ... } }

  }else{
    searchParams.set("resource", id);
    const url = window.location.pathname+"#"+searchParams.toString()
   return push(url) // { type: '@@router/LOCATION_CHANGE',  payload: { ... } }
  }

}
```

### cancel an action

You can cancel an action from with-in the action .js file before it starts by not returning any value

**Example:**
```JS
export function action (payload,user){
  if(payload.id === user.id)
    return
  else
	 return fetch('/api/foo/bar/user/'+payload.userId)
}
```

## index files

**"index"** files are need for each attribute folder you make.

This file can exposes three funtions
1) before
2) default
3) after

You can also [istening for other actions](#istening-for-other-actions) from other parts of the store.

#### before

Fires on every action, to tweek the **payload** that will be passed to you logic functions.

```js
// add a time stamp to the payload that will be recived by user reduced
export function before(user, action){

	return Object.assign({},action.payload,{ timeStamp : new Date() })
}
```

#### default

This is a normal redux reducer function, being passed the **previousState** and the **action**.
```js
export default function user(user = {name:"?"}, action) {
  return user;
}
```

âš  This function will be fired on all actions, **EXCEPT** for actions that are handled by a specific action file in this reducer folder.

Lets understand this with an example:

**Files:**
```
store/
 â”œâ”€â”€user/
 â”‚  â””â”€â”€ index.js
 â”‚  â””â”€â”€ changeName.js
 â””â”€â”€posts/
    â””â”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ delete.js
```
**code:**

```JS
import actions from 'redux-auto'
...
actions.user.changeName({name:"brian"})
```
The default functions for **store/user/changeName.js** & **store/post/index.js** will be fired.

**store/user/index.js was NOT** called because there is a specific action file a to handle it for user.


#### after

Fires after every action, allowing you to change your piece of the **state**.

```js
import actions from 'redux-auto'

// automatically keep a log of all actions against user
export function after(newUserValues, action, oldUserValues){

	const changes = {}

	if(action.type in actions.user) // log if this is a user action!
		changes.log = newUserValues.concat(log,[{action.type:action.payload}])

	return Object.assign({}, newUserValues, changes)
}
```

#### listening for other actions

There are two built-in ways to detect other actions from within your index.
1)You can find if the current fire action that you have received matches a specific action **and** 2) You can find if their current action is part of another piece of the store.

1. To find if the correct action is a specific action. [Import the actions](#actions-are-available-in-the-ui) as you normally would and do a **loose** equality check.

**Example:** We want to have a count of how many post our user has done
```js
import actions from 'redux-auto'

export default function user(user = {name:"?", posts:0}, action) {

  // You can check on each state of an asynchronous action
  if(actions.posts.save.fulfilled == action.type){
    return Object.assign({},user,{posts:user.posts+1})

    // And non-synchronous actions can be checked directly
  } else if(actions.posts.something == action.type){
    // ... do some work ...
  }

  return user;
}
```

2. If you wish to listen to all actions from a specific part of the store. You can use the `in` keyword.

**Example:** We wish to log all post actions
```js
import actions from 'redux-auto'

export default function logging(log = [], action) {

  // test if the action type is within the posts
  if(action.type in actions.posts){
    return [...log, action]
  }

  return log;
}
```

## handling async actions in your UI

redux-auto has a built in mechanism to flag what stage an async action is in..

if the state that you returned from your reduce function is an object or array. redux-auto will transparently attach a "loading" property representing all async actions.

The "loading" flag can have 1 of 4 values

1) `undefined` : the async action has not been fired yet
2) `true` : the action is in progress
3) `false` : the action has completed successfully
4) `error` : an error occurred and here is the error object + a "clear" function to reset the async to `undefined`

* Note: The async action will also have the clear function if at any time you want to reset the "loading" property.

     `actions.user.save()` is the async function and

     `actions.user.save.clear()` will clear the "loading" property.


example:


```JS

// user = { name:"tom" }

JSON.stringify(state.user) // "{ "name":"tom" }"

state.user.loading.save // = undefined

actions.user.save()

state.user.loading.save // = true

// when the request or promuse completed

state.user.loading.save // = false

// if the was a problem. it will be was to the error object

state.user.loading.save // = Error("some problem")
// + with an Error, there will also be a "clear" function to set the "loading" back to undefined
// e.g. state.user.loading.save.clear()

```

## smart actions

**smart actions** is an options flag that handly `actions` function more intelligently.

Currently facilitates [graphql](http://graphql.org/) and [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) responses returned by action's promises.

**To enable:**

```JS

import { auto } from 'redux-auto';

auto.settings({smartActions:true})

```

This will now parce fetch and graphQL errors into your `rejected` function.
As well as parsing the json if available

## Testing

If you want to use a testing frameworking. There is helper funcsion [/test/fsModules](https://github.com/codemeasandwich/redux-auto/blob/master/test/fsModules.js)

**For [jest](https://jestjs.io/) example:**
```JS
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { auto, reducers } from 'redux-auto';
import fsModules from 'redux-auto/test/fsModules'
import App from './Main';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';

const storePath = path.join(path.dirname(fs.realpathSync(__filename)), 'store');
const webpackModules = fsModules(storePath)
const middleware = applyMiddleware( auto(webpackModules, webpackModules.keys()))
const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers), middleware );

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App store={store} />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```
